## Welcome, to a very simple idle game.

### What I use
- Vanilla HTML (not sure what else you'd use)
- Vanilla JS for most logic
- Cash for dealing with the DOM
- watcher.js (my own lib) to store data and dynamically update ui and text
- Tippy.js for tool tips when hovering over curtain elements

The game is hosted on [Github Pages](https://jacoby-y.github.io/super_simple_idle/)
